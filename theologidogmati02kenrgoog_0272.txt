DE PURGATORIO. 26⁹

sumanvuttsto.

62. Purgatorium esse probavimus: que antem enimn i'ui detineantur
indicavimus, eas seilicet qui levioribus culpis, quas veniales vocemus, dis·
cesserint inquinate, vel que haud satis expiaverint peccata graviora poeni·
entire operibus. De loco, poenamm genere, vel duratione nihil duximus
proferendum, ne fidei limites pretergredi videremur. Ceterum apud La·
linos obtinet sententia ignis poenam irrogandam. Charites viventium erga
defunctos exercetur orando pro eis, offerendo sucrificium, eleemosynas
dando, et ulicis divinam iis implorando misericordiam. Indulgentiarum
etiem applicatio iis fieri potest, sd modum suffugiis De* his alius disse·
ruimus.

(l) Juvat Oxoniensium verba renitere: ,“ There is ons other means ci cscsping dre
pernities dne to sin in Purgatory, which may bricfly he mentioned, viu: by the grant oi ‘
indulgencesc thessere dhpemed on the following theory. Granting thet a certain fixed
temporal penalty is attached to every act oi siu, in such ceseii would he conceivable
that, as the multitude of Christiane did not discharge their total debt in this life, so some
. ernaordinary holy men might more then dischargdt. Such are the Propheta, Apostles,
llnrtyrs, Asoetics, end the like, who have committed few sins, and hare undmgone ex·
treme labours end sufferings, volnntcry or involuntery. This being supposed, the ques·
tion'rises, what becomes cs the overplns; and then there seems a fitness thet whutis
uct needed ior themselves, should avril ior the brethren who ere still dehtcre. It is ac·
cordingly stored, together with oannes merits, in ahiud cf treasure-honse, to be dis·
psused according to the occadon, end that at the discretion of the Ohurch. The appli-
oetion oi this tresenreis ended an indulgence, which stands instead of a oedem time oi
peaance in this lile, or lor the period, whatever it be, to whieh thet time is commntedin
Purgatory. In this wey, the supererogatory works oi the Saints are supposed to go in

paymant ol the debts cl ordinary christiam.” TrantNe.79,13.l.
